	<br><p>Numerous commuters rush into entrances of stations of Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit (KMRT) between the Orange Line and Red Line at 7 o’clock in the morning either for work or school; at 5 o’clock in the afternoon, there is another wave of people heading back home or going on a dinner date. During the off-peak times there are trains at stations every 6 to 8 minutes, which is a long time waiting compared to every 2 to 3 minutes for the ones of Taipei Metro! Those who are looking forward to their trip to Kaohsiung have all done their research in their time of waiting. They may pick up their smartphones to look for information of the stations they are arriving at, quickly rent the C-bikes as soon as leaving the stations and riding across scenery spots like Love River’s riversides, Sizihwan or Qijin while indulging themselves by tasting the most authentic cuisines.</p><br>	
	<p>KMRT has provided not only comfortable and safe traffic transportation services since its opening, but also tightly connects to the public transportation system of the city to allow citizens and tourists experiencing the convenient life of “seamless integration”. Those who are not familiar with Kaohsiung City may use “KMRT APP” to search the traveling information neighboring the destination stations to save times from looking at maps after leaving stations or consulting with KMRT staff. As more and more people prefer strolling down the cities with bikes, there are renting stations of C-bikes at each stations of KMRT. However, they could be all rent-out at popular scenery spots. With the App in hand, people can search the status of renting, and if you are at Zuoying Station, the information of transportation of Taiwan High Speed Rail and Taiwan Railways won’t be missed for you to take.</p><br>
	<p>The public arts is another focus of tourism of Kaohsiung. Japanese architect Shin Takamatsu was invited to design the structure of Formosa Boulevard Station, which is at the intersection point of the Orange Line and Red Line. The Italian American artist built the “Dome of Light” that combined with painted glass. In addition, there are the ship-shape looking of World Games／National Sports Complex Station, presenting the traditional cultural elements of Shihjia Station. If you don’t have enough time to visit these gorgeous artworks, the VR+ and panorama guiding system can be the best application for you to experience different scenery in each station of KMRT. You can preview every corner as well as the entrances and traffic lines of stations on the smartphones to get prior knowledge of neighboring scenery scope to avoid getting lost!</p><br>
	<p>When you arrive at Formosa Boulevard Station, you can put on the brand new HTC Vive helmet to experience the panorama VR guiding trip as if you are traveling at Love River or Lotus Lake. You may as well put on related accessories such as 3D glasses to enjoy such virtual traveling to make your trip even more interesting. If you have difficulties arranging your travel or getting the most authentic enjoyment, the APP arrangement function installing the most advanced A.I. technology can help you with arrangement of personal traveling schedule. The interactive services connect food, accommodation, fun and shopping information just to broaden the possibility of cloud traveling and make searching more smart and efficient.</p><br>

Also, you can play interactive games with KMRT Girls (the virtual brand representative of KMRT) to win bonus points to exchange gifts from shops, further making the nearby markets more prosperous. If you want to purchase local specialties, the KMRT Markets has gathered all local goodies and travel package tickets to save purchasing times in lines.
