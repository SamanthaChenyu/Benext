	<br><p>歲末年終，當我們除舊佈新時，清理出來的物品繁多，包括退流行服飾、不再想看的書本、超商集點與百貨公司兌換禮物……，該怎麼處理呢？不如把它們捐給需要的人，透過資源回收或二手交換的途徑，讓它繼續物盡其用，成為綠色生活的實踐。</p><br>
	
	<p>智慧城市的美好願景中，「回收就是資源！」不再是空洞的口號，而是隨時隨地正發生的循環生態，如同春夏秋冬的四季輪轉，各種資源的循環也不斷流轉再利用，努力達成「零廢棄全循環」的目標。大豐環保科技為臺灣資源回收業龍頭，透過回收服務APP「資源循環生態系服務平臺zero zero」，製作全方位「回收地圖」與「分享地圖」，讓民眾即時掌握住家附近的回收與分享訊息，節省運送過程的成本，也能降低運輸過程的碳足跡。</p>
		
	<p>「回收地圖」標示社區回收據點，包括除了大型回收據點，也將服務資源回收的個人小站列入其中，方便一般人做資源回收，甚至可以透過這個回收地圖，預約大量資源回收的服務。未來將陸續出現在臺灣各地的無人回收站，利用電子化磅秤系統I-pound，民眾只要將資源回收物放置於電子秤上進行秤重，就能獲得Z幣，兌換綠色商品、二手商品，或是捐贈給公益團體。</p><br>

	<p>「分享地圖」讓大家能夠交換分享訊息，透過訊息公布，讓有需要物品的人，能夠互換有無，也讓物品能找到新主人。除此之外，針對企業的工業回收，透過「物料管理系統」控管廢棄物料的種類、數量，並透過Z Car系統，預約合作物流與廠商的回頭車，降低運送的費用。同時也能透過這個平台，追蹤廢棄物的終點去向，確保環境的安全。</p><br>

<p>垃圾危機是全世界共同面臨的課題。據估計，全世界人口，每天製造大約350萬噸垃圾。大量無法就地回收、掩埋或焚化的垃圾，下場多為流入大海中，塑膠製品在海洋中形成垃圾島，污染海洋、造成海洋生物的死亡。針對萬年不滅的塑膠，透過確實的回收與分類，分碎處理、混練造粒等流程，形成再生物料後，就能再次回到生產線，製成塑膠製品，像是瓶罐、文件夾，甚至能夠抽絲紡製成衣服，讓塑膠變成全新的物品。</p><br>

	<p>目前臺灣的垃圾回收率高達55%，與先進國家同步，美國的《華爾街日報》還專文盛讚「臺灣：世界上的垃圾處理天才」：從55%到100%「零廢棄全循環」，資源回收成為智慧城市的一環，將有效資源創造成更有價值的商品，回收服務平台豐富未來城市的樣貌。</p><br>

	<br><p>At the New Year’s Eve, when we are replacing old stuff with new ones and cleaning up a wide range of items, including unfashionable clothes, unwanted books, merchandise points and department stores exchanged gifts etc. How to deal with them? It is better to donate them to the needed people through the exchange of resources or second-hand exchange approach to let them continue to make the best use for the practice of green life.</p><br>	
	<p>For the good vision of smart city, "recycling is the resources!" is no longer an empty slogan but a cycle of ecology at anytime, anywhere just as the four season rotation. The cycle of various resources continues to flow and be re-used, the goal is for "full cycle with zero waste ". Da Fon Environmental Technology, the leading company of resource recycling industry in Taiwan. By applying the recycle service APP — "zero-zero platform of resource recycle ecological services”, it enables people to make the all-aspect "Recycling Map" and "Sharing Map" to have them get recycling and sharing information immediately, and save the logistic cost as well as reduce the carbon footprint of the transportation process.</p><br>
	<p>The "Recycling Map" identifies the community's recycling sites, including large ones and individual stations to have people recycle more conveniently, and even recycle the large amount of resources via the reservation mechanism. In the future, it will continue to appear in the unmanned recycling stations around Taiwan. For the use of electronic scale system I-pound, people just need to put the recycled resources on the electronic scales for weighing, and they can get Z currency to exchange for green goods, second-hand goods or donate them to charities.</p><br>
	<p>The "Sharing map" can allow people to exchange information, through the announcement, people who need the goods can exchange with each other, as well as find new owners for the items. In addition, for the industrial recycling of enterprises, they can control the type and quantity of waste materials through the "material management system" and make appointment with cooperative logistics and hitchhike the transportation of manufacturers via the Z Car system, which is available for reducing the logistic cost. Also, the use of this platform is available for tracking the destination of the waste to ensure the safety of the environment.</p><br>
<p>Waste crisis is a common problem faced by the world. It is estimated that all of the world's population generates about 3.5 million tons of garbage daily. A large number of the waste cannot be recycled, buried or incinerated., They are often ended up floating into the ocean, and we have seen plastic products that form trash islands on the surface of the oceans and pollute them, causing the death of marine life. For the “immortal” plastic, via the real recycling and classification, crushing treatment, mixing granulation process, and the formation of renewable materials, they can be once again returned to the production lines and made into plastic products, such as bottles, folders, and even spinning for clothes, so that plastic can become a new items totally.</p><br>
	<p>Currently, Taiwan's waste recycling rate is up to 55%, which is at the same level as the ones of advanced countries. The American "Wall Street Journal" also praised in an article written " Taiwan: The World's Geniuses of Garbage Disposal ": from 55% to 100% of " full cycle of zero waste " became a part of the smart city, turning resources efficiently to create more valuable goods, and enrich the future city’s appearances by the recycling service platform.</p><br>
